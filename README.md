## Folder Structure

Each assignment has its own folder were all files
related to it are stored including the pictures within
the blog.

The folder naming scheme is as follows

```
Where:
* Number is the assignment number
* DueDate is the date the assignment was due in the format yyyymmdd

## Assignment Structure

Each blog has a header including the assignment number,
name of the assignment, course number, and my name.
There is also a table of contents laying out the
structure of the blog. The pictures are somewhat
descriptively named primarily as ease of adding them to
the blog.
