## Selected Case Study
I've decided I want to explore the company Segment and 
their journey from a monolith to microservices and then 
back to a monolith.

Some sources:
* [Why Microservices?](https://segment.com/blog/why-microservices/)
* [Goodbye Microservices](https://segment.com/blog/goodbye-microservices/)
* [To Microservices and Back Again](https://www.infoq.com/news/2020/04/microservices-back-again/)
* [Why Segment Returned to a Monolith from Microservices](https://www.infoq.com/news/2018/07/segment-microservices/)

### Why this study?
I think this is an interesting case study as it brings
a different perspective from a lot of the other case
studies on the microservice architecture. There are many
case studies telling the story of a successful 
transition from a monolithic architechture to a 
microservice architecture and how it greatly improved 
their performance in both development and execution. 
This case study shows how a microservice architecture 
is not always the best option and it might be better to stick to a more tradtional monolithic architecture.
