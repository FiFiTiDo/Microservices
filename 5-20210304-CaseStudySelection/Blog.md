## Selected Case Study
I've decided I want to explore case study number 13, 
Zalando's experience with microservices in 2015.

### Why this study?
I am interested in this case study because it is really
relevant to this course based on how they strutured
their new architecture around their business logic as
in domain driven design. I also am interested in
learning how their market impacts their architecture,
whether it comes with some banefits or challenges.
Culture is a very important part of a microservice
architecture and I wish to explore how they achieved it
so well.
