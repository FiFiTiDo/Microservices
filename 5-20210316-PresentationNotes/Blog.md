## My Thoughts About the Presentation

I thought that the presentation was very well done and
helped to put the concepts we have been learning in our
lectures into context. It helps to see a working example
to get a better understanding of Microservices and their
benefits and how they manifest and function in an actual
situation.

The indepth overview on the structure of Filbo's 
architecture was very interesting annd shows how
complex the architecture can be. He explained everything
very well and thouroughly including how it operates,
how they made the decisions they made, and what they
built it using. This complexity really shows how it
might not work for every situation because it can
become too complex to outweigh the benefits of the
architecture.
